* Implement a regression testing suite.

* Add support for break/continue statements in Jminor.

* Refactor Java/Dafny code backends. They currently share
  90% of their code.  

Guard inference:
----------------
* We can heuristically focus on a set of relevant basic propositions
  by conducting a value-dependence analysis on a trace.
  If, at a point in the trace, a value is not read in remainder of the trace,
  it is most likely irrelevant at that point.
